Review:
	- Java
		- Mature language, a lot of support for it
			- Oracle backed
		- Multiple programming paradigm
			- OOP
			- functional
		- OS independent
			- JVM
		- Multithreaded
		- Automatic memory management
		- compiled language
		- strictly typed language
	
	- JDK/JRE/JVM
		- JDK
			- Java Development Kit
				- Tools to create java application
				- Compiler
				- Java Runtime Environment
					- Everything that is needed to run an application
					- Java Virtual Machine
					- java core libraries
	
	- Variables
		- primitives (stored in stack)
			- whole numbers
				- byte, short, int, long
			- floating points
				- float, double
			- boolean
			- char
		- reference types (stored in stack): refers to an object in heap

	- String
		- immutable array of characters
			- meaning cannot be changed, when a value is reassigned, a new String is created (if needed)
		- denoted by quotation marks: "this is a string"
			- String s = "Hello";
				- leverages the String pool
					- a place in the heap for strings to be reused
			- String s1 = new String("Hello"); 
				- does not leverage the String pool and creates a new String everytime

	- Methods
		- reusable block of code that can take in arguments and return something
			- void: method does not return anything
			- return value;
		- Methods should focus on doing one thing well
		- main method
			- entrypoint for the jvm
	
	- Control flow statements
		- if/else if/else
		- for
		- while
		- do while
		- switch


Naming Conventions in Java
	- PascalCase for ClassName/InterfaceName
	- camelCase for methodName/variableName
	- reverse url for package declaration: com.revature.tranhuu
	- can't be reserved keywords

Arrays
	- groups of elements of the same datatype, can be primitives or objects
	- Arrays are contiguous blocks in memory and as such the size of an array must be specified when initialized
	- Elements in an array can be selected using their index, index starts at 0
		- arrays have a property called "length"
			- represents the length of an array
			- .length
	- boolean[] bools = {true, false, true}; 
	- boolean[] bools = new boolean[3];

Conditional Operators:
	- &, | - bitwise operator: evaluates both sides
	- &&, || - short circuit operators: evaluates one side if enough

Ternary operator
	- shorthand version of an if statement
	- [expression to be evaluated] ? [ if True ] : [if False];

Packages
	- group items based on what they do/ provide logical structure
		- separation of concerns:
			- a package to hold all models/entities
			- a package to hold all classes related to data persistence
			- a package to hold all classes related to business logic (services)
			- a package to hold all classes to interact with the web 
	- are declared at the top of the class
		- follows the reverse URL format/ reverse domain name
		- package com.revature.models;
	- folder structure
		- allows for resolution of naming conflicts
		- define access (access modifiers)
			- how classes can access one another

Class
	- Blueprint for object, defines states and behaviors
		- states refer to field, properties
		- behaviors refer to methods
		- objects can be instantiated using the new keyword which calls the constructor
	- Constructors
		- special method that has no return type and are used to create an instance of a class
		- called using the "new" keyword
		- default constructor: a no args-constructor provided by the compiler if NO OTHER CONSTRUCTOR IS PROVIDED (No args or parameterized)
		- no-args constructor: constructor with no parameter
		- parameterized/overloaded constructor: constructor with one or more parameters

Exercise:
	- create model with at least 2 states and 1 behavior.
	- create a no args constructor and a parameterized constructor
	- test it out in a separate file with a main method
	- push it to github
