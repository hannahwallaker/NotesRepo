SonarCloud
	- cloud-based code analysis to detect code quality issues to provide maintainability, reliability, and security to the codebase
	- provides static code analysis to detect
		- code smells
			- do not prevent code from functioning
			- can make code less maintainable
		- bugs
			- errors in code that can prevent the program from operating as intended
		- vulnerabilities
			- problems in the code that could be exploited to compromise the security of the application

Setting up Sonar cloud for your back-end repository
	- Create new organization/analyze new project
		- (might need admin approval from me)
	- Select repository
	- set up
	- Select GitHub Actions for Analysis method
		- follow instructions
			- GitHub Secret
			- .github/workflows/build.yml
				- select maven
					- in the build.yml file, update the branch name from master to the branch you'd like to analyze
					- on:
					    push:
					      branches:
						- [branch-name]
	- if you're using Spring profiles, update the Jenkinsfile 'package' stage from 

      stage('package') {
         steps {
            sh 'mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
         }
      }

	- to

      stage('package') {
         steps {
            sh 'mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Pprod'
         }
      }

	- in order to run the prod profile instead of dev
