DevOps
	- set of practices that combines software development with IT operations
	- goal is to create "high quality code" more efficiently
		- often associated with Agile
	- building, testing, deploying, maintaining the software
	- DevOps pipelines
		- set of automated processes and tools that allow developers and operations to collaborate in building and deploying code to a production environment

DevOps practices
	- CI
		- Continuous Integration
			- practice of constantly merging source code, often to a centralized location/repository
				- meant to prevent large error from accumulating
				- to make sure that people are working with the latest code base 
	- CD
		- Continuous Delivery
			- Having the application in a constant state to be deployed "at the push of a button"
				- but not deploying yet
	- CD
		- Continuous Deployment
			- once code is integrated and passes the test, sent to production environment
				- live environment

Maven (review)
	- build automation tool and dependency management tool
		- dependencies are downloaded locally in the .m2 folder
	- Lifecycle
		- clean - removing old artifacts, deletes the target folder
		- default
			- broken down in different phases
				- validate
				- compile
				- test
				- package <- generates an artifact(.jar)
				- verify
				- install
		- site

Jenkins
	- Open-sourced automation server/ build automation tool
		- allows us to automate CI/CD/CD processes
	- Plugins allow Jenkins to add additional functionality
		- ie: maven, gradle, git...
	- Jenkins Job
		- project managed by Jenkins, set of repeatable steps to be automated by Jenkins
			- ie: pulling code for Github, packaging, creating image ...
			- build trigger
				- defines when the job should run/be executed
					- can do manually
					- set up webhook using GitHub
						- allows Github to notify our Jenkins server once the main branch has been updated
			- Build status
				- green: success
				- yellow: unstable
				- red: failure
			- weather forecast:
				- how often build failed lately
	- Jenkinsfile
		- text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins pipeline 
			- added to git repository
			- set of repeatable steps to be automated by Jenkins
