Hibernate Exercise:
	- Building upon our Hibernate example, the Employee class has been mapped using annotations.
	In Hibernate, relationships between entities can be illustrated using annotations defining their multiplicity:
		- @ManyToOne, @OneToMany...
			- Take a look at the Employee model for an example
	- In your group, implement the EmployeeHibernate class methods using Hibernate.
	- Application Set up:
		- The project has been changed to use h2 instead of a PostgreSQL database, meaning no need to change any credentials.
		- Once the project has been imported into your workspace, run a Maven update and you should be able to run the application.
		- The main method has a sequence to commands to show if the methods have been implemented
			- since they are called in sequence, do implement them in order 
	- While you can work together, everyone should upload a version to their repository on GitHub
